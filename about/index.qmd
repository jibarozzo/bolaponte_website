# Hello human!

## Thanks for visiting my website!

My work centers on applying reproducible data pipelines in R (with a dash of Python) to amplicon and whole-genome sequencing datasets to unravel the complex interactions between microbial symbionts and their plant hosts—ranging from tropical trees to alpine yellow monkeyflowers, and most recently, bioenergy feedstocks 

I leverage a range of statistical and machine learning methods, and linear modeling to analyze genomic and ecological data. Learn more about my interests by visiting [Research](/research).

As a committed advocate for open, transparent, and reproducible science, I empower people around me to extract meaningful insights from data by sharing my knowledge on data visualization, data wrangling, and data analysis. Additionally, I collaborate with the [ESIP Data Stewardship Committee](https://www.esipfed.org/) to advance best practices in data management and stewardship. You can learn more about my teaching experience by visiting [Teaching](/cv/#teaching-experience).

## About me

::: grid
::: {#about-me-1 .g-col-6}
**Data scientist \<- Ecologist and evolutionary biologist**

I love learning, teaching and mentoring about R, Python, reproducible science and many things in ecology and evolutionary biology. That curiosity to learn about systems and how they work and how we can extract information and iterate to better and more efficient systems is what drives me. Some of the questions fuel this:

-   How does it work?

-   How can I make it so others understand it?

-   How can I make it better?

I'm a big fan of open science and reproducibility, and I'm always looking for ways to make my work more transparent and accessible to others. Participating in open source project and reproducible science is a constant exercise that can always be improved. Exercising it gives back to the community and helps me learn and grow.

My research spans from studying ant communities in the tropics to microbial fungi in Yosemite. I focus on how communities assemble and interact with their environment, using R and Python to create explore large genomic datasets.
