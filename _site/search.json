    "text": "Fungal Endophytes and Yellow Monkeyflowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoliar Endophytes in yellow monkeyflowers along elevation gradients in the Sierra Nevada (in-process)\nMicrobes play crucial roles in plant health and adaptation, but their distribution is influenced by environmental conditions, geographic distance, and plant species. Fungi have helped plants colonize various climates, but little is known about how plant microbiomes affect local adaptation.\nThis study focused on foliar endophytic fungi (FEF), which can help plants survive stressful conditions like drought. We explored how FEF communities in Mimulus species (monkeyflowers) vary with elevation and interact with leaf traits. Mimulus species, found in diverse habitats from dry outcrops to alpine meadows, offer an ideal system to study plant-microbe interactions.\nUsing genetic sequencing, we examined how FEF communities change across three Mimulus species in the Sierra Nevada mountains, revealing insights into how these fungi respond to environmental conditions and host leaf traits.\nCollaborators:\n\nCaroline M. Dong\nKathleen G. Ferris\nSunshine A. Van Bael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMimulus guttatus field in Stanislaus National Forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon garden experiment in granite outcrop at Yosemite National PArk\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype and phenotype interactions with foliar fungal symbionts in common gardens (in-process)\nIn the face of climate change, to survive, plants rely on both genetic changes and their ability to adapt to changing environments. We know that plants form beneficial partnerships with fungi and bacteria, however the role of these microbes in helping plants adapt to their environments is less understood. Building on previous findings, this research tests how foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) respond to host leaf traits in a reciprocal transplant experiment. By crossing M. guttatus and M. laciniatus and obtaining F2 hybrids we aim to understand the contributions of host plant genetics and phenotype, and the environment to FEF community composition.\nOur results may shed light on how plants and their microbial partners work together to adapt to diverse and challenging environments. By exploring how fungi help plants respond to different environmental stresses (planted in the other species environment: meadows and granite outcrops), we can better predict how plant species might cope with the rapid changes in climate, offering insights into plant survival and biodiversity conservation.\nCollaborators:\n\nCaroline M.

That curiosity to learn about systems and how they work and how we can extract information and iterate to better and more efficient systems is what drives me. Some of the questions fuel this:\n\nHow does it work?\nHow can I make it so others understand it?\nHow can I make it better?\n\nI’m a big fan of open science and reproducibility, and I’m always looking for ways to make my work more transparent and accessible to others. Participating in open source project and reproducible science is a constant exercise that can always be improved. Exercising it gives back to the community and helps me learn and grow.\n\n\nMy research spans from studying ant communities in the tropics to microbial fungi in Yosemite. I focus on how communities assemble and interact with their environment, using R and Python to create explore large genomic datasets.\n\n\nPh.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ∙ Tulane University ∙ 2024\n\n\nM.Sc. in Natural Resources Management-Conservation Ecology ∙ University of Michigan ∙ 2018\n\n\nB.S. in Political Science ∙ University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras ∙ 2014"

My journey didn’t stem from learning best practices. As a trained ecologist and evolutionary biologist (EEB), R and computational tools were primarily a means to answer the big questions in my field. But what really pushed me to dive deeper was frustration—specifically, with how knowledge is often transferred in academia.\nMore often than not, the way academics learn R, at least in my experience and among my peers, is through a kind of trial by fire—often fueled by term paper deadlines or the looming pressure of thesis and dissertation submissions. It’s more like learning in the middle of a wildfire, to be honest. Learning R (or any coding tool) takes a backseat to the immediate goal: submitting the paper or presentation abstract. The familiar mantra becomes, “I’ll clean up the code later,” but those end up being famous last words before orphaning a repository, incomplete and messy.\nThis chaotic learning process has predictable pitfalls. From absolute paths breaking code on a different machine to accidentally deleting entire directories and freaking out in meetings when code refuses to run on a colleague’s setup, I’ve seen it all (Jenny Bryan would burn everyone computers). But it was through these frustrations that I began to unlearn bad habits and embrace reproducibility. Unlearning requires constant effort. Tools like version control, renv, .Rproj, and others became liberating. Yes, they require a little more planning at the start of a project, but having code that runs seamlessly on another person’s machine without issue? That’s priceless.\nFor software developers, this might sound like old news, but for many biologists, reproducibility is still an uphill battle. We’re more familiar with the thrill of analyzing data than the discipline of building reproducible environments.\nPersonally, my drive to write and share code comes from an innate need to help others benefit from the little I’ve learned. But more than that, creating rigorous and reproducible science isn’t just an academic exercise; it’s a moral compass.\nWhat have I learned?\nLately, I’ve been taking Programming in R course by Posit Academy and learning functional programming concepts, which I highly recommend even if your a seasoned useR. This has prompted me to refactor much of the code I’ve produce to be more maintainable and human. My main focus has been plot reproduction. Some of my code has hundreds of lines producing ggplots that can easily be turned into a function(s).\nLet’s see some example of how to use purr::map() to automate plot generation.\nSetup\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nThe tidyverse meta package includes ggplot (plots generation), purrr (iteration), and dplyr (data wrangling) the three main packages we will be using. ### The problem Copy and paste code to produce plots.\n\n# Body mass vs. flipper length\npenguins |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = T, level = 0.95, na.rm = F) +\n    labs(title = \"Penguin Body mass (g) vs. Flipper length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Body mass vs. bill depth\npenguins |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = T, level = 0.95, na.rm = F) +\n    labs(title = \"Penguin Body mass (g) vs. Bill depth (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Body mass vs. bill length\npenguins |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = T, level = 0.95, na.rm = F) +\n    labs(title = \"Penguin Body mass (g) vs. Bill length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe with just three plots this isn’t a big deal. It quickly becomes a hassle to keep track of when you have over a dozen variables and the plots are roughly the same that it’s not worth writing a whole new chunk. I’ve omitted creating respective object for the plots, but that is how I would usually store them and call them throughout the analysis (e.g., bodymass_fliplen or something like that). Again, that quite fine in a small script of analysis.\nNow, how do we automate this?\n\n\n Back to top"
