    "text": "Fungal Endophytes and Yellow Monkeyflowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoliar Endophytes in yellow monkeyflowers along elevation gradients in the Sierra Nevada (in-process)\nMicrobes play crucial roles in plant health and adaptation, but their distribution is influenced by environmental conditions, geographic distance, and plant species. Fungi have helped plants colonize various climates, but little is known about how plant microbiomes affect local adaptation.\nThis study focused on foliar endophytic fungi (FEF), which can help plants survive stressful conditions like drought. We explored how FEF communities in Mimulus species (monkeyflowers) vary with elevation and interact with leaf traits. Mimulus species, found in diverse habitats from dry outcrops to alpine meadows, offer an ideal system to study plant-microbe interactions.\nUsing genetic sequencing, we examined how FEF communities change across three Mimulus species in the Sierra Nevada mountains, revealing insights into how these fungi respond to environmental conditions and host leaf traits.\nCollaborators:\n\nCaroline M.

We know that plants form beneficial partnerships with fungi and bacteria, however the role of these microbes in helping plants adapt to their environments is less understood. Building on previous findings, this research tests how foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) respond to host leaf traits in a reciprocal transplant experiment. By crossing M. guttatus and M. laciniatus and obtaining F2 hybrids we aim to understand the contributions of host plant genetics and phenotype, and the environment to FEF community composition.\nOur results may shed light on how plants and their microbial partners work together to adapt to diverse and challenging environments. By exploring how fungi help plants respond to different environmental stresses (planted in the other species environment: meadows and granite outcrops), we can better predict how plant species might cope with the rapid changes in climate, offering insights into plant survival and biodiversity conservation.\nCollaborators:\n\nCaroline M.

    "text": "More often than not, the way academics learn R, at least in my experience and among my peers, is through a kind of trial by fire—often fueled by term paper deadlines or the looming pressure of thesis and dissertation submissions. It’s more like learning in the middle of a wildfire, to be honest. Learning R (or any coding tool) takes a backseat to the immediate goal: submitting the paper or presentation abstract. The familiar mantra becomes, “I’ll clean up the code later,” but those end up being famous last words before orphaning a repository, incomplete and messy.\nThis chaotic learning process has predictable pitfalls. From absolute paths breaking code on a different machine to accidentally deleting entire directories and freaking out in meetings when code refuses to run on a colleague’s setup, I’ve seen it all (Jenny Bryan would burn everyone computers). But it was through these frustrations that I began to unlearn bad habits and embrace reproducibility. Unlearning requires constant effort. Tools like version control, renv, .Rproj, and others became liberating. Yes, they require a little more planning at the start of a project, but having code that runs seamlessly on another person’s machine without issue? That’s priceless.\nFor software developers, this might sound like old news, but for many biologists, reproducibility is still an uphill battle. We’re more familiar with the thrill of analyzing data than the discipline of building reproducible environments.\nPersonally, my drive to write and share code comes from an innate need to help others benefit from the little I’ve learned. But more than that, creating rigorous and reproducible science isn’t just an academic exercise; it’s a moral compass. My journey didn’t stem from learning best practices. As a trained ecologist and evolutionary biologist (EEB), R and computational tools were primarily a means to answer the big questions in my field. But what really pushed me to dive deeper was frustration—specifically, with how knowledge is often transferred in academia.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

But it quickly becomes a hassle to keep track of when you have over a dozen variables and the plots are roughly the same that it’s not worth writing a whole new chunk. I’ve omitted creating respective object for the plots, but that is how I would usually store them and call them throughout the analysis (e.g., us_scatter or something like that). The issue with this approach is that it is prone to a lot of error. Copying and pasting, then tweaking the code ever so slightly is a major source of human error (e.g. forgetting to change the x variable). Again, its manageable now, but not with bigger projects."

    "text": "Behold, the list column\n\nWhen we work with R work are working with object that are atomic vectors of different types (e.g., character, numerical, integers, floats, etc.). One of the most powerful data structures in R are lists. Lists are a collection of objects that can be of any type. This makes them very flexible and powerful. We can have a list of data frames (which are list themselves), plots, functions, etc. In this exercise, map() returned a list of ggplots. Now one of the most useful things I have learned lately is the list columns.\nList columns are a column in a data frame that contains a list. This is allows us to store multiple objects in a single column. Having a list column within a data frame or by it self can help us reduce the number of intermediate object that we create within a project. Instead of creating an object for each plot or linear models, we can store them in a list column in a single object that we can access and use throughout our analyses.\nLet’s see how lists columns work. We are going to use nest() to summarize grouped data by nesting the non-grouping variables into a list column of data frames—one data frame per group.\n\nlife_expectancy &lt;-\n  gapminder |&gt; \n  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp) |&gt; \n  group_by(country, continent) |&gt; \n  nest()\n\nlife_expectancy\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 3\n# Groups:   country, continent [142]\n   country     continent data             \n   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;list&gt;           \n 1 Afghanistan Asia      &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 2 Albania     Europe    &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 3 Algeria     Africa    &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 4 Angola      Africa    &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 5 Argentina   Americas  &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 6 Australia   Oceania   &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 7 Austria     Europe    &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 8 Bahrain     Asia      &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n 9 Bangladesh  Asia      &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n10 Belgium     Europe    &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nNow we have a data frame with column data that contains a list of data frames. We can use map() to apply a function to each element of the list column.\nLet’s define some useful functions to fit a linear model, plot the data, and predict life expectancy in 2030.\n\n# Functions to fit a linear model, plot the data, and predict life expectancy in 2030\nfit_pop &lt;- function(df) {\n  lm(pop ~ year, data = df)\n}\n\nplot_pop &lt;- function(df) {\n  ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = pop)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm)\n}\n\npred_pop &lt;- function(mod) {\n  input &lt;- tibble(year = 2030)\n  predict(mod, newdata = input)\n}\n\nNow we can use map() to apply these functions to each data frame in the list column.\n\n# Fit a linear model to each data frame in the list column\ngap_list_df &lt;- gapminder |&gt; \n  select(country, year, pop) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  nest() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    model = map(data, fit_pop),\n    plot = map(data, plot_pop),\n    pop_2030 = map_dbl(model, pred_pop)\n  )\n\ngap_list_df\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 5\n# Groups:   country [142]\n   country     data              model  plot     pop_2030\n   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;list&gt;            &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;    33846451.\n 2 Albania     &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;     4879306.\n 3 Algeria     &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;    43758285.\n 4 Angola      &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;    14598072.\n 5 Argentina   &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;    49706374.\n 6 Australia   &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;    25613532.\n 7 Austria     &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;     8784507.\n 8 Bahrain     &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;      956764.\n 9 Bangladesh  &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;   187136396.\n10 Belgium     &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;gg&gt;    11138373.\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nFor each country we have a group data frame within data column, a linear model in model column, and a ggplot in plot column.

    "text": "About me\n\n\nData scientist &lt;- Ecologist and evolutionary biologist\nI love learning, teaching and mentoring about R, Python, reproducible science and many things in ecology and evolutionary biology. That curiosity to learn about systems and how they work and how we can extract information and iterate to better and more efficient systems is what drives me. Some of the questions fuel this:\n\nHow does it work?\nHow can I make it so others understand it?\nHow can I make it better?\n\nI’m a big fan of open science and reproducibility, and I’m always looking for ways to make my work more transparent and accessible to others. Participating in open source project and reproducible science is a constant exercise that can always be improved. Exercising it gives back to the community and helps me learn and grow.\n\n\nMy research spans from studying ant communities in the tropics to microbial fungi in Yosemite. I focus on how communities assemble and interact with their environment, using R and Python to create explore large genomic datasets.\n\n\nPh.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ∙ Tulane University ∙ 2024\n\n\nM.Sc. in Natural Resources Management-Conservation Ecology ∙ University of Michigan ∙ 2018\n\n\nB.S. in Political Science ∙ University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras ∙ 2014"
