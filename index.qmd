::: {#hero-heading}
I am researcher and data scientist with experience in statistical analyses and data visualizations in **R** and **Python**. 
My research focuses fascinating microbial fungi that live inside (*endophytes*), how they interact with plant hosts, and their distribution along environmental gradients. I am also passionate about reproducible science, open-source software, and data literacy.
