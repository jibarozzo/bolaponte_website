::: {#hero-heading}
I am researcher and data scientist with 8+ years of experience in data
mining and statistical analyses in R and Python. My research focuses fascinating microbial fungi that live inside leaves called *endophytes*, how they interact with plant hosts, and their distributions along environmental gradients. I am also passionate about reproducible science, open-source software, and data literacy.
