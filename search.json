    "text": "About me\n\n\nData scientist &lt;- Ecologist and evolutionary biologist\nI love learning, teaching and mentoring about R, Python, reproducible science and many things in ecology and evolutionary biology. That curiosity to learn about systems and how they work and how we can extract information and iterate to better and more efficient systems is what drives me. Some of the questions fuel this:\n\nHow does it work?\nHow can I make it so others understand it?\nHow can I make it better?\n\nI’m a big fan of open science and reproducibility, and I’m always looking for ways to make my work more transparent and accessible to others. Participating in open source project and reproducible science is a constant exercise that can always be improved. Exercising it gives back to the community and helps me learn and grow.\n\n\nMy research spans from studying ant communities in the tropics to microbial fungi in Yosemite. I focus on how communities assemble and interact with their environment, using R and Python to create automated workflows that extract insights from large genomic datasets. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques and machine learning algorithms, I explore how factors like elevation and location influence microbial communities in plants.\n\n\nPh.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ∙ Tulane University ∙ 2024\n\n\nM.Sc. in Natural Resources Management-Conservation Ecology ∙ University of Michigan ∙ 2018\n\n\nB.S. in Political Science ∙ University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras ∙ 2014"
